Experiments with DBN and RBM

This repository is made especially for testing the dll library. It
won't be be stable, and it is quite possible that some of the
examples will not be compilable for a possibly long time.

Building
++++++++

To build the examples, simply use:

.. code:: bash
   make

All the executables will be located in the release_debug/bin
directory. Some of the executables include options (look at the
source file to get the options).
